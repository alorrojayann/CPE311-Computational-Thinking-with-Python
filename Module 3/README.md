# ðŸ’» Graphs
Welcome to the "Graphs" repository! This repository is a comprehensive guide to understanding and working with graph data structures, including theoretical concepts, practical implementations, and applications.

## Overview
Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. They consist of nodes (vertices) and edges (links) that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are widely used in various fields such as computer science, biology, social science, and more, to represent networks, relationships, and pathways.
