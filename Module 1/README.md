# ðŸ’» Introduction to Computational Thinking and Optimization
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and resource for understanding the fundamental concepts of computational thinking and the principles of optimization.

## Overview
Computational thinking is a problem-solving process that involves understanding a problem, designing a solution, and expressing the solution in a way that a computer can execute. It includes a range of skills such as logical reasoning, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design.

Optimization is the process of making something as effective or functional as possible. In computational terms, it involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, often under given constraints.
