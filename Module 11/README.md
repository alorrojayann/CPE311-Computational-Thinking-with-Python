# ðŸ’» Introduction to Machine Learning
Welcome to the "Introduction to Machine Learning" repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the fundamentals of machine learning, covering key concepts, algorithms, and practical applications.

## Overview
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the study of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to perform specific tasks by learning from and improving over time.
