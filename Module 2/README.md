# ðŸ’» Decision Trees and Dynamic Programming
This repository is dedicated to providing a thorough introduction and practical resources for understanding decision trees and dynamic programming.

## Overview
Decision trees are a popular machine learning method used for classification and regression tasks. They use a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes and resource costs.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is used in a variety of optimization problems where decisions need to be made in stages.
